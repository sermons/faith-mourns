You **adulterous** people, don’t you know that <br/>
**friendship** with the **world** <br/>
means enmity against God?

Therefore, anyone who chooses to be <br/>
a friend of the world becomes an **enemy of God**.

<span class="ref">5</span>
Or do you think Scripture says without reason <br/>
that he **jealously longs** for the **spirit** <br/>
he has caused to dwell in us?

But he gives us more **grace**. <br/>
That is why Scripture says:

“God **opposes** the **proud** <br/>
but shows **favor** to the **humble**.”

<span class="ref">7</span>
**Submit** yourselves, then, to God. <br/>
**Resist** the devil, and he will **flee** from you. <br/>
<span class="ref">8</span>
Come **near** to God and he will come near to you.

**Wash** your hands, you **sinners**, and <br/>
**purify** your hearts, you **double-minded**.

<span class="ref">9</span>
**Grieve**, mourn and wail. <br/>
Change your laughter to **mourning** <br/>
and your joy to **gloom**.

<span class="ref">10</span>
**Humble** yourselves before the Lord, <br/>
and he will **lift** you up.
